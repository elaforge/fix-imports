- Doesn't understand that 'import X as Y' is the same as
'import qualified X as Y'

- If I set Util.Map in prio-module-low or Data.Map in prio-module-high, why
does Util.Map still get imported?

* Bug: never import the current module

- Bug: Track imported Cmd.Lang.LTrack, should match entire component, not
just prefix.

- Exception should be Control.Exception, not Exception

* Read per-project priorities so e.g. it looks for Data.Map before Util.Map
or Util.PPrint before App.PPrint

* Also need prio within system libs, e.g. GHC.* modules should be low prio

* Should search in subdirs of current top level module name?  E.g., in
Derive.Call.Note, Internal gets Cmd.Internal, not Derive.Deriver.Internal

* Index should use Text instead of String

* IO should be System.IO, not Data.Text.Lazy.IO
  And Process should be System.Process, not System.Posix.Process

- If the choice is still ambiguous I could ask interactively.

- Or write a simple tool to analyze existing code and assign priorities
based on how often each is imported.
