* done; - not done; / decided against

- import-order-last: Synth.Lib.Global doesn't work
  . Maybe it just does first match, not most specific match?
  . Because order only expects toplevel name.
  . I can generalize to longest prefix match.

- Use a cabal sandbox if one is present.

/ Optionally write a cache of the package db.
  . No need, most time is spent in haskell-src-exts parsing.

- Use haskell-names to guess the module to import based on the function name:
  http://documentup.com/haskell-suite/haskell-names
  This could even potentially support unqualified imports.

/ Didn't want to import Ui.Types when I already have Types imported
unqualified.
  I think this is working as intended, because an unqualified import can also
  be used qualified.

* If I set Util.Map in prio-module-low or Data.Map in prio-module-high, why
does Util.Map still get imported?  It's because local modules are always
prioritized above package ones.  To fix this I could have a ad-hoc map of e.g.
'Map -> Data.Map' to manually set certain resolutions.
  . Or, why not just make local vs global only apply when not in
    prio-module-high or prio-module-low.
  . I think I just change the order in Config.prioritize.  Could it be that
    simple?

- If the choice is still ambiguous I could ask interactively.

- Or write a simple tool to analyze existing code and assign priorities
based on how often each is imported.
