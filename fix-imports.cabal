synopsis: Program to manage the imports of a haskell module
description:
    fix-imports is a small standalone program to manage the import block of a
    haskell program.  It will try to add import lines for qualified names
    with no corresponding import, remove unused import lines, and sort the
    import block according to some heuristic you can define.  This only works
    for qualified imports!  Unqualified imports are left untouched.
    .
    It's most convenient if bound to an editor key.  See the included vimrc
    for an example.  You may have to cabal unpack or git clone to see it.
