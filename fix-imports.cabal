synopsis: Program to manage the imports of a haskell module
description:
    fix-imports is a small standalone program to manage the import block of a
    haskell program.  It will try to add import lines for qualified names
    with no corresponding import, remove unused import lines, and sort the
    import block according to some heuristic you can define.  This only works
    for qualified imports!  Unqualified imports are left untouched.
    .
    It's most convenient if bound to an editor key.
    .
    Recent major changes:
    * version 1.0.2
    .
    * Fix bug where a qualified import with >1 dot wasn't found.  And don't
    mess with Prelude.
    .
    * version 1.0.1
    .
    * Fix a bunch of bugs: properly recognize unqualified imports as imports,
    never import the current module, don't pick up modules with the same suffix
    but a different name.
    .
    * version 1.0.0
    .
    * Change name from FixImports to fix-imports, which is more unixy.
    .
    * Change ghc-pkg parsing from String to Text.  It's noticeably faster.
    .
    * Add a more flexible system for prioritizing imports.
    When there are several possibilities for a module name, they are all given
    to a single function to decide.  The config file moved from
    fix-imports-priority to .fix-imports and can now specify sort orders for
    packages and modules by prefix.
    .
    * Make -i includes for non-existent dirs ignored instead of causing an
    error.
