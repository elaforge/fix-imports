There are a few things which can be configured.  Edit src/Main.hs and mess with
the Config it passes in.  There isn't much configurability but what there is
should be documented in the modules in which it is defined.

See the vimrc for an exmaple of how it can be bound to a key in vim.

It'll reformat the import lines, including an import list if you have one.
Sorry about that.  The formatting style of Language.Haskell.Exts.prettyPrint
is not my personal style.  If it ever bothers me enough maybe I'll write my
own formatter, or come up with a way to not reformed unqualified imports.

Also, it will search for modules starting from '.', so you should be in the
root of the module hierarchy.  It wouldn't be hard to add a -i flag though.
